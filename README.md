# DensityHapticSimulation
DensityHapticSimulation is a simulation in chai3d using the Falcon controller, we created it to teach small children the concept of density and mass, using some spheres and a tower that they need to throw down with the spheres.
## Installation
To be able to install and execute this code you need the [chai3d](https://github.com/chai3d/chai3d/tree/master) library and the [Falcon](https://hapticshouse.com/products/white-falcon-3d-touch-haptic-controller) controller. Then you will need to compile the chai3d library for your sistem, it supports all OS and add the code to the path:modules/BULLET/examples/GLFW/02-bullet-pool as we used the same name to make it easier to compile without modifing the makefiles inside the project.
## Usage
Ejecute the app and enjoy.
